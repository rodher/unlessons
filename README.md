This repository holds parts of code developed by people at the GreenLSI group, used here for code review, in order for all of us to improve our programming skills. 

The repo organization is the following: each folder contains a different discussion topic based on actual code, and different versions show how the code has been improved. 
To see the comments on the code, and how and why things are changes, just look into the commits. 
Each commit comes with a high-level explanation on the main changes


Feel free to browse, comment and ask questions!
